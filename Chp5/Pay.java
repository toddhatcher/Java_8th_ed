// Write an interactive Java payroll application that calculates the net pay for a factory
// worker. The program prompts the user for skill level and hours worked, as well as
// appropriate insurance and retirement options for the employeeâ€™s skill level category.
// The application displays: (1) the hours worked, (2) the hourly pay rate, (3) the regular
// pay for 40 hours, (4) the overtime pay, (5) the total of regular and overtime pay, and
// (6) the total itemized deductions. If the deductions exceed the gross pay, display an
// error message; otherwise, calculate and display (7) the net pay after all the deductions
// have been subtracted from the gross. Save the file as Pay.java
